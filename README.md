## Matrix

In this project, you will implement three classes: Matrix, RowMatrix, and RowMatrixOperations. These matrices are simple two-dimensional matrices that must support addition, matrix multiplication, and a simplified General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) operation.

In this header file, we define the three classes that you must implement. The Matrix abstract class defines the common functions for the derived class RowMatrix. The RowMatrixOperations class uses RowMatrix objects to achieve the operations mentioned in the overview above. The function prototypes and member variables are specified in the file. The project requires you to fill in the implementations of all the constructors, destructors, and member functions. Do not add any additional function prototypes or member variables. Your implementation should consist solely of implementing the functions that we have defined for you.
