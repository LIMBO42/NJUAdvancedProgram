#### 题目描述

要访问顺序容器和关联容器中的元素，需要通过“迭代器（iterator）”进行。迭代器是一个变量，相当于容器和操纵容器的算法之间的中介。迭代器可以指向容器中的某个元素，通过迭代器就可以读写它指向的元素。从这一点上看，迭代器和指针类似。

###  Why we use iterators??

Well, first off, if you're reading some kind of book or tutorial that suggests doing something like:

```C++
for(std::vector<T>::iterator it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it) {
    std::cout << *it << '\n';
}
```

...you should probably get a newer book because as of C++11 the preferred way is with a range-based for loop:

```
for(const auto & elem : vec) {
    std::cout << elem << '\n';
}
```

Not only is it less to type, there's fewer opportunities for mistakes. For example, you don't have to repeat the type of the vector, so if it changes there's nothing to update.

But that aside, the reason for using iterators is that they abstract away the differences between containers. Take a look at any of the algorithms of the standard library. These all deal in iterators, which makes them container-agnostic. Take sorting for instance:

```C++
template< class RandomIt >
void sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt last );
```
This one function can work with any sequence container that has random access iterators, which includes:

* `C arrays`

* `std::array`

* `std::vector`

* `std::deque`

* `std::string (which can be treated as a container of char)`

* popular third party libraries, e.g. `boost::stable_vector`, `boost::ptr_vector`, `boost::ptr_deque`, etc.

* your own containers

That's a pretty remarkable feat. Imagine if you had to have a different version of std::sort() for every different kind of container. It would be a mess, and it wouldn't be expandable because the implementation that comes with your standard library wouldn't be able to work with custom types. Iterators are what make this possible. (And that example is one of the milder cases, since std::sort requires random access. There are numerous algorithms that only require forward iterators and work with many more containers like std::list or std::map, and so on.)

And by the way, all of the above applies equally to the range-based for loop, which is really just syntactic sugar on top of the traditional method of iterating over a container using iterators.

So, I think it's of great importance to get a glimpse of how to implement the iterator and I hope this lab will be helpful for your future study.


#### about this lab

Because I believe what I cannot create I don't understand, so I want you to know how to add a iterator for your own container. I will explaine them to you below.

you can just think that we can iterate a HashMap by the order defined below:

```
for(int i=0;i<hashMap->bucket_count();++i){
    auto curr_node = hashMap->_buckets_array[i];
    while(curr_node != nullptr){
        ...
        curr_node = curr_node -> next;
    }
}

```


|||
|-|-|
|`iterator(const HashMap*mp,bool end)`|constructor, you need to initlize private menbers in this function|
|`iterator(const iterator&it)`|constructor, useful for you implementation in `iterator operator++(int)`|
|`iterator&operator++()`|let curr_node point to the next node and return curr_node|
|`iterator operator++(int)`|return the curr_node and let curr_node point to the next node|
|`iterator&operator=(iterator&other)`|I think this does the same as constructor|
|`iterator&operator=(const iterator&other)`|above|
|`==,!=`|judge whether two iterators are the same. If they both point to the end postion or the same node,they are the same.|
|`value_type& operator*()`|return value stored in curr_node|
|`value_type*operator->()`|return address of value stored in curr_node|
|`bool key_equal(const K&_key)`|judge whether key of curr_node is _key|
